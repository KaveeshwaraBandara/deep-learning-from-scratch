# Neural Networks from Scratch

This repository is based on **Andrej Karpathy’s Neural Networks / Deep Learning playlist**.

The playlist teaches deep learning by breaking neural networks down to their core ideas and rebuilding them step by step. It covers how neurons work, how models learn through gradients and backpropagation, and how simple mathematical components come together to form powerful learning systems.

The purpose of this repository is to follow the playlist closely while updating my understanding through code and notes, with a strong focus on learning deep learning **from first principles** rather than using high-level abstractions.
